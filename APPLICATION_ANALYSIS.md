- Stripe API for payments

## 4. User Journey Map

### 1. Discovery & Registration
- User discovers PromptPro AI through marketing or search
- Signs up using Replit Auth (social login)
- Lands on the home page with a basic free tier account

### 2. First Prompt Creation
- User navigates to the main prompt editor
- Selects parameters from dropdown menus (action verb, output format, style, tone)
- Uses either the Classic or Prompt Pro editor mode
- Enters content/context for their prompt
- Clicks "Generate" to create their first AI response

### 3. Response Evaluation & Refinement
- Views generated AI response
- Can provide feedback (thumbs up/down)
- Adjusts parameters and regenerates
- Saves successful prompts for future use

### 4. Subscription Management
- Encounters generation limit (5 per month for Basic tier)
- Views subscription options (Basic: $0/mo, Pro: $29/mo, Premium: $59/mo, Enterprise: $149/mo)
- Upgrades via Stripe checkout to increase generation limit
- Manages subscription in user dashboard

### 5. Advanced Usage
- Uses Prompt Pro mode to create more structured prompts
- Leverages smart defaults based on usage patterns
- Explores A/B testing variations of prompts
- Views analytics on prompt effectiveness

## 5. Key Features & Implementation

### Authentication System
- Replit Auth integration using OpenID Connect
- Session persistence across server restarts
- Role-based access control (admin vs regular users)

### Prompt Editor
- Two modes: Classic and Prompt Pro
- Smart defaults with preference tracking
- Parameter selection with contextual suggestions
- Real-time preview of raw prompts

### Template System
- Modular template components
- A/B testing of template variations
- Version tagging for tracking and analysis
- Model-specific optimizations

### Response Visualization
- Formatted response display
- Feedback mechanisms (thumbs up/down)
- Metadata tracking (generation time, model used)
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality

### Subscription Management
- Tiered pricing model with generation limits
- Stripe integration for payment processing
- Webhook handling for subscription events
- User-friendly upgrade/downgrade flow

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive network error detection
- User-friendly error messages with recovery options
- Generation limit detection with upgrade prompts
- API rate limiting protection

## 6. Database Schema

Key entities in the database:
- **users**: User accounts with subscription information
- **prompts**: Saved prompts with metadata and settings
- **responses**: Generated AI responses linked to prompts
- **categories**: Organizational structure for prompts
- **apiKeys**: Encrypted API keys for external services
- **userPreferences**: Tracking of user preferences and defaults

## 7. Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Error Handling
**Solution**: Implemented a multi-level error handling system that:
- Detects network issues with specific error scenarios
- Provides user-friendly messages with recovery options
- Handles generation limit errors with subscription upsell
- Implements retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

### Challenge: LLM Integration
**Solution**: Created a provider-agnostic interface that:
- Supports multiple AI models through a unified API
- Handles API key management securely
- Adapts prompt templates for model-specific optimization
- Provides fallback mechanisms when models are unavailable

### Challenge: User Experience
**Solution**: Implemented progressive disclosure that:
- Starts with simple interface for new users
- Reveals advanced options as users become more experienced
- Provides smart defaults based on usage patterns
- Includes conflict detection for incompatible options

### Challenge: Subscription Management
**Solution**: Built a secure payment system that:
- Integrates with Stripe for payment processing
- Manages generation limits per subscription tier
- Handles subscription lifecycle events via webhooks
- Provides clear upgrading/downgrading paths

## 8. Performance & Scalability Considerations

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **API Rate Limiting**: Protection against excessive requests
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures
- **Caching**: Response caching for frequently used prompts
- **Analytics**: Usage tracking for optimization

## 9. Compliance & Security

- **API Key Encryption**: Secure storage of third-party API keys
- **Payment Security**: Stripe integration for PCI compliance
- **Authentication**: Secure session management with OIDC
- **Data Protection**: Minimal data collection policy
- **Error Messages**: User-friendly error messages without leaking sensitive information

## 10. Success Metrics

- **User Engagement**: Time spent in app, prompts generated
- **Conversion Rate**: Free to paid subscription conversions
- **Retention**: Monthly active users and churn rate
- **Response Quality**: User feedback scores on generated content
- **Generation Efficiency**: Time to generate optimal prompts
