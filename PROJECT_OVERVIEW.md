# AI Prompting Tool - Project Overview

## Project Summary

The AI Prompting Tool is a web application designed to help users create highly effective prompts for AI interactions. It features a modern React/Tailwind frontend and an Express.js backend with PostgreSQL database for persistence.

## Key Features

- **Structured Prompt Building**
  - Task Definition (Goal, Output Format, Style, Tone)
  - Instruction Builder (Action Verbs, Specific Details, Role-Playing)
  - AI Model Selection

- **Prompt Management**
  - Save and organize prompts by categories
  - Mark favorite prompts
  - Track prompt history

- **Response Generation**
  - Generate AI responses based on structured prompts
  - Track generation time and model used

## Technology Stack

| Component     | Technology                                      |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**  | React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn UI components      |
| **Backend**   | Express.js, Node.js                            |
| **Database**  | PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM                    |
| **State Mgmt**| React Query, React Hook Form                   |
| **Styling**   | Tailwind CSS, shadcn UI                        |
| **Build**     | Vite, TypeScript                               |

## Architecture Overview

- **Frontend**: Single-page application built with React
- **Backend**: RESTful API built with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for schema management
- **API Communication**: JSON over HTTP
- **Authentication**: Not yet implemented (planned for future)

## Data Model

- **Users**: Store user information
- **Prompts**: Store prompt configurations
- **Responses**: Store AI-generated responses
- **Categories**: Organize prompts into categories

## Current Status

- Core UI components implemented
- Database schema and relations defined
- PostgreSQL integration complete
- Basic prompt generation flow working
- Task definition and instruction builder components integrated

## Implementation Details

- Follows component-based architecture
- Uses TypeScript for type safety
- Database operations abstracted through storage interface
- RESTful API endpoints for data operations
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
