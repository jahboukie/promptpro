## Implementation Priority

1. **User Authentication** - Essential for a production application
2. **UI/UX Improvements** - Enhance user experience
3. **Prompt Management** - Core functionality improvements
4. **Analytics and Insights** - Provide value through data
5. **Advanced AI Features** - Expand capabilities
6. **Collaboration Features** - Enable team use cases

## User Feedback Channels

To prioritize future development effectively:

1. Implement in-app feedback mechanism
2. Create a feature request board
3. Set up regular user interviews
4. Analyze usage patterns to identify pain points
5. Run beta programs for new features

## Measuring Success

For each enhancement, define:

1. Key performance indicators (KPIs)
2. Success metrics
3. User adoption goals
4. Performance baselines and targets
5. Business impact assessments

## Resource Planning

Each enhancement should be assessed for:

1. Development effort (story points)
2. Required team members (frontend, backend, design)
3. External dependencies
4. Timeline estimates
5. Testing and QA requirements
